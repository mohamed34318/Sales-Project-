<p>
in the project we have dataset stored in execl file and after doing some analysis and cleaning and make KPI to extract some result i found some solutions that will be useful ,
<h3>Here's what we found:</h3>
<ul>
<li> The top 5 products with the highest sales are as follows: MacBook Pro Laptop ($8,025,700), iPhone ($4,788,000), ThinkPad Laptop ($4,126,000), Google Phone ($3,313,200), and 27in 4K Gaming Monitor ($2,427,750). We should focus on these products and provide customers with some offers.
</li>
<li>Some products have a low number of sales, such as the Lightning Charging Cable ($324,150), USB-C Charging Cable ($262,308), Wired Headphones ($226,188), AA Batteries (4-Pack) ($82,232), and AAA Batteries (4-Pack) ($61,836). I suggest trying to change the locations where these products are sold and introducing some offers on them.
</li>
<li> We used a KPI called Monthly Sales Growth to track revenue growth each month. December was the month with the highest sales</li>
<li> Tuesdays were found to be the best day in 2019 and 2020, with the highest number of orders and sales</li>
<li> The most popular cities that contributed to increased revenues were San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City</li>
<li> The best times for customers to place orders were 11:58 AM, 7:36 PM, 7:20 PM, and 1:25 PM. These times had a high number of requested orders. On the other hand, times like 3:28 AM, 3:47 AM, 3:42 AM, and 4:23 AM were not popular and had a low number of orders.</li>
<li> In terms of states, California (CA), Texas (TX), and Massachusetts (MA) had the highest sales rate, which is very common.</li>
<li> The top 5 streets with the highest number of orders were 661 Madison St, 60 10th St, 329 Hill St, and 689 7th St.</li>
</ul>
